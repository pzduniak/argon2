# argon2

** WARNING: This is a port of the argon2 version 1.0, which is vulnerable to some
tradeoff attacks. [Issue #2](https://github.com/pzduniak/argon2/issues/2) was created
to track the progress. Up until this is fixed, using `pzduniak/argon` is not recommended.
This library was written to allow usage of libargon2 in Go on Windows. Recently I have
made some changes to the `tvdburgt/go-argon2` bindings so that it works in such
environment. [Link's here.](https://github.com/pzduniak/go-argon2) **

Go conversion of the [libargon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2)
library. Exports a simple API with only several features. Unwrapped round
function is taken from [magical/argon2](https://github.com/magical/argon2),
licensed under the MIT license.

Please note: due to the nature of the conversion, its performance might be lower
than of [the bindings](https://github.com/tvdburgt/go-argon2). Also the memory 
clearing is NOT ported and depends on the GC.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/pzduniak/argon2
```

## Performance compared to bindings

Tests were ran on a 2015 Macbook Pro Retina 15". The conversion is ~3.5 times
slower.

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/pzduniak/argon2"
)

func main() {
	var (
		password = []byte("password")
		salt     = []byte("testsalt123")
	)

	output, err := argon2.Key(password, salt, 3, 4, 4096, 32, argon2.Argon2i)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(hex.EncodeToString(output))
}
```
